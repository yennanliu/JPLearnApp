🧠 Prompt:

Create a single-page frontend-only web app using Vue 2 framework that helps users learn Japanese through daily-use sentences. The app should:
	1.	Display a randomly generated simple Japanese sentence (with `traditional chinese` translation) commonly used in everyday life (e.g. “おはようございます” - “早安”).
	2.	Include a button to play the sentence audio using the browser’s SpeechSynthesis API.
	3.	Allow the user to speak the sentence using the browser’s SpeechRecognition API and provide feedback (e.g. “Great! You said it correctly” or “Try again”).
	4.	Not require any backend — all logic and data (like a small list of sample sentences) should be handled in the frontend.
	5.	Be styled minimally but clearly using scoped CSS.
	6.	All the code (HTML, CSS, JS) should be in one file (App.vue) using single-file component format for Vue 2.

Please make sure it’s self-contained and doesn’t rely on external APIs or backends.
